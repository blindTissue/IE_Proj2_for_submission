### IE Proj 2

To run this, create a python enviorment with numpy and matplotlib, jupyter notebook installed. 
The notebook should have a comprehensive description of each section. 
Overarching writeup located at writeup.pdf

### Structure
- `IE_Proj_2.ipynb`: The main jupyter notebook containing all the code and explanations for the project.
- `log_likelihood_plot_average.png`: A plot showing the average log-likelihood for each word in the test set, used to determine the most likely word.
- `log_likelihood_plot_constrastive_average.png`: A plot comparing the log-likelihoods of the most likely word against other words in the test set, illustrating the contrast in likelihoods.
- `most_likely_word_and_confidence.txt` : Most likely word and a confidence interval for test set
- `most_likely_word_and_confidence_contrastive.txt`: Most likely word and a confidence interval for the contrastive test set

Also includes log_likelihood plot where the axis the sum of the log likelihood.
